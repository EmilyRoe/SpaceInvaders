# SpaceInvaders

## About

This project is a simple game based loosely on Space Invaders. This challenge was approached with an OOP mindset and is a simple text only game with a single button that hits a random alien ship in the fleet. Each time the button is pressed, a random alien ship is hit and its hit points are reduced. Once an alien ships points have hit zero the ship is destroyed and can't be hit again. The game is over once all alien ships have been destroyed. 

## Functionality

This game has three different types of ship, the mother ship, attack ships and defence ships. Each ship has been allocted a set number of points through an if statement. The deduct points function then is then used to remove a set amount of points from the individual ships at random via the shoot button.

Once all the points hit zero, a 'You Win!' message appears and the user can click the play again button to restart the game.
